[“The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable
silence of the world” - Albert Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus]

A discussion in the ways in which both authors present the phenomenon of consciousness in 1984
by Orwell and The Road by McCarthy...

Consciousness is the portrayal of the human mind. In both texts, the authors greatly analyse
the effect that disparity and oppression have on consciousness and suggest their concepts
of the ideal mind. Albert Camus’ gripe with the absurd extends to an almost nihilist point of
view that the world is devoid of meaning. It is impossible to rationalise with the state of the
world, yet we are born with a desire to make reason of it. He proposes that the human
condition is a perpetual cycle of curiosity followed by failure upon a neverending attempt to
find meaning. McCarthy directly allows his characters to play with the idea of purpose amidst
his dying world, as he uses symbolism, religion, modernism, and modern literary techniques
(such as the diegetic nature of the novel) to represent his ideas of what purpose a human
has once the world has left them. The threnodic dystopia that McCarthy appoints is not
dissimilar to Orwell’s Oceania of 1984. Orwell tackles the themes of the human condition,
and the “confrontation” that is created between an active consciousness and a power that
wishes to “silence” them. His application of totalitarianism, Stalinism, and extremist
propaganda becomes a warning to the threat that political ideologies have on the human
“consciousness”. Together they explore different worlds with a culmination of various themes
to both suggest unique forms of absurdity. Both futures are bleak in nature yet were arrived
through different means. The wider scope of analysis provides detail that the tragic nature,
and conclusion that Albert Camus has arrived at, of the human “consciousness” is present
throughout context and literacy. The constant presence of the absurd is universal, and it is
through the authors that we can view the extent to which our environment has on our own
mind, and how we perceive the world.
In McCarthy’s The Road, the desolate, bleak atmosphere of the landscape, with its
“darkness implacable”, personifies the emptiness as relentless in its wake. We are taught the
world holds an unforgiving nature, with an agency for disaster. There is the presence of
modernism, for this environment acts as a comment on the fragility of the current world.
McCarthy has taken influence in current affairs of society and injustice to generate a bleak
future for his characters. The inevitable quality of his world produces a threnodic tale,
slipping in and out of the homodiegetic and heterodiegetic, we as the reader peer into the
very “consciousness” of the protagonist and his son. Their relationship itself is juxtaposed
against the collapsing world, for it is the device that allows these characters to continue to
overcome adversity in a dying world. McCarthy takes a biographical influence, bucketing his
own instincts from his fatherly duties to his son, and paints them onto the man and the boy.
In a world where the external provides no hope, the protagonist must search inwards, and
find drive in his natural responsibilities to his son, as “god appointed him” to do so.
Consciousness is argued to be boiled down to, at its root, a collection of primal instincts and
urges, compounded with civilised beliefs. The constant back and forth reassurance between
the man and his son on the idea that they are “carrying the fire” demonstrates their need to
hold onto some civility in order to not truly lose themselves to archaic behaviours and views.
Their “consciousness” self imposes a responsibility to retain civility as that provides a means
to go forward. Absurdity is found in the “need” to survive against the “silence” of the
wasteland, this forces the characters into a delusion that McCarthy allows the reader to

recognise as false. He captures this in the modernist technique of fragmented, diegetic,
streams of consciousness scattered throughout the novel. The reader is able to dip into the
eyes and mind of the man, whilst remaining omnipresent. McCarthy demonstrates this when
he describes the environment that surrounds his protagonists, as the world is “sustained by
a breath, trembling and brief. If only my heart were stone”, he is able to move fluidly between
the local ambience of the scene, and the emotions that plague his characters. This creates a
sense of subjectivity in what the characters believe and act on. We cannot accept the
reasoning of the man or the boy, yet we are allowed to understand them. In terms of hope,
we see how consciousness builds these walls of false promise, and how believable they may
seem, whilst whitenessing the true reality of their situation. We recognise the “absurd” nature
of survival.
This sense of hope is also captured in 1984, with Winston’s promise to overturn the
totalitarian regime of Big Brother, yet whilst we understand the hope will forever live on in the
relationship of the son and the man, 1984 provides no ground for Winston’s hope beyond his
own consciousness, and it is this that ultimately comes crashing down by the end of the
novel. Throughout the story we are introduced to themes of fascism, and Stalinism,
accumulating in the heavily policed state of Oceania. We witness parallels in the man and
Winston, for they are both outliers, anomalies. They reject the environment they exist in and
wish to reach a point of change. Winston discovers hope in rebellion for he believes his “true
life is in the future”, acknowledging that his current standard of living is no better than death.
Orwell places a fascist regime as inhumane, and in turn suggests that it is the “conflict” with
the human consciousness, personified in Winston, that sparks hope.It is in Orwell’s use of
irony in the idea of “doublespeak” that we see oxymorons produced in the “Ministry of Love”,
“war is peace”, and “freedom is slavery”, which contrasts optimism with harsh truth. The
humour that Orwell creates in a world where these contradictions are excepted suggests
absurdity. These concepts are accepted as the public lack the knowledge and no able use of
language, disorientated by The Party’s introduction of “new speak”, to differentiate between
the two major concepts. In turn, they take the phrases at face value and become numb to
either extreme. Orwell is speaking of the contemporary social issues that plague Western
democracy. Critics that adopt the views of Jean-Francois would suggest Orwell as a
post-modernist, and that Winston, and the readers, suffer from the condition to question and
mistrust any propaganda or evidence of a collective narrative. Orwell’s world suffers from the
post-modern “consciousness” that the narratives people follow in society are never wholly
true, yet they are able to coexist together. He speaks of the concerns surrounding how much
power a state is allowed to have on thought and education, accusing totalitarianism as the
extreme result of no boundaries between the leaders and their people. Much like The Road,
it becomes a tale of a depressive outlook on the future, yet with the humanist values of
liberty to think and act being deprived, we are left with a sense of hopelessness. McCarthy
and Orwell both agree that hope is enacted in humanistic values. The boy and the man
succeed in retaining their hope, for in a “godless world” they are still “prophets”, by deciding
to look inwards, allowing the consciousness to produce barriers and symbols to drive them
forward. For Winston, his attempt to speak out and challenge the external results in his loss
of hope and eventual acceptance of the regime. He betted his consciousness against a
world that lacked one, and in turn was broken. It is McCarthy’s belief in isolationism and self
delusion that hope may survive in the “absurd”, which agrees with Orwell’s belief that any
attempt to challenge the “absurd” lack of hope is to sacrifice your own. Proven when
Winston’s motif comes full circle, he succumbs to the Party by etching ‘2 + 2 = 5’. Winston

has lost any final essence of hope that remains, and in turn he must place all his trust into
his institution, and their ‘teachings’. He must “have to believe it”, for in the absence of hope
he has no reason to challenge order, Winston embraced the “absurd”. People “have” to
follow these rules, which suggests a complete void of hope in Orwell’s world, as there is the
lack of alternatives in a society controlled by the totalitarian Big Brother.

This theme of isolationism is rooted further into each novel, and intertwines at various points
throughout. McCarthy’s tale is an ode to the strength in relationships. His characters
maintain a stable consciousness by holding onto their connection with one another.
Acknowledging that “the boy was all that stood between him and death”, a great amount of
pressure is placed on the father-son relationship that runs through the novel. There is an
amount of significance in the decision McCarthy takes to describe the tale of two characters
who preserve their morals and civility in a world with no promise; he places an emphasis on
the benefit to the “consciousness” in maintaining relationships. The characters found along
the road can be interpreted as McCarthy’s warnings towards a lack of morality. Even those
who are accompanied in groups appear in a hierarchical chain. Their relationship stems from
a need for survival. McCarthy’s man and child retain a relationship that transcends survival.
The man witnesses the boy as his own personal saviour, for he believes, “if he is not the
word of God God never spoke”, in reference to his son. McCarthy places religious essence
on the bondage of a father and son, that not only is it an ideal but its importance outweighs
“God” himself. The ability to live on through his son, that he may “carry the fire”, and with it
the lessons of his father. Immortalised in morals and philosophy is the closest one will get in
a “godless world”. That is the true afterlife of the father. His relationship with his son reaches
beyond mortality. Critic Sanchez would argue that the boy
1
“almost acts as a Messiah”, as he
is a “guiding figure” to the man. McCarthy considers the bond of a father and son to be
something spiritual and divine. Sanchez agrees that the boy retains what is good. By
chasing his own morals imprinted in the child, the man will never lose them. That is
survivability to McCarthy: A never ending game of philosophical cat and mouse. This is
mirrored in the child. For after the death of his father, he “tried to talk to God” but found it
easier to speak to his Father. He succeeded “God” as the child’s moral compass. To
McCarthy “God” resembles peace and morality, yet also evolution. Darwinistic undertones
permeate the novel, as it may be suggested that the man and child, and their relationship,
pointed at the intersection of survivability and morality. They held onto modern values
through faith. McCarthy’s protagonists are able to expand their “consciousness” through faith
in order to separate themselves from the primitive cannibals. This creates parallels to how
the concepts of faith and religion divided man from ape. Religion provided order out of the
“absurdity” of the archaic world of our ancestors, and it is that same concept now that holds
our characters from falling into that same “absurdity” once more. Yuval Noah Harari, author
of Sapiens, would critique religion as a
2
“system of human laws that is founded on a belief in
superhuman laws”, when discussing the creation of religion. He insisted that humans are the
only species to develop such concepts, and so there is agreement with McCarthy that it is
the morals and judgement of the man and the child shared with one another that allow them
to maintain their “human need” for normality.

Whilst faith and therefore a healthy conscience can be maintained for McCarthy through
companionship, it is the complete lack of in 1984 that Orwell demonstrates how power can
be released from God and into the hands of the oppressor. With all religion and faith absent
in the novel, any assumed power is given to The Party. When being tortured by O’Brien,
Winston rejects the idea of God suggesting it is the “spirit of man” that shall prevail. Orwell
creates a humanistic prophet in Winston, as he carries the “spirit” of the human
“consciousness”. His circumstances mirror that of Christian heroes who endure torture to
their bodies yet continue to spread their faith. Winston’s attempt at remaining true attains
similarities to the crucifixion of Christ. Yet, where these characters overcome their
persecutors, Winston gives in. Rejecting the repeated fable of good overcoming bad through
endurance, Winston becomes a message to the reader that God, and the justice that he
brings, does not exist to the people in this totalitarian future. Big Brother has surpassed the
faith of God. A story based 35 years into the future, Orwell uses his story as a warning that
political ideologies, when an extreme is capable of wielding such power as Big Brother, will
not only suppress but replace religious ideologies. This message is hard to swallow, when
Winston embraces his own ignorance, as Orwell places Winston in the trope of an underdog,
with the implied destiny to prevail. The twist marks 1984 as a tragedy, to what Winston
represents - the human soul. In turn, the authors both theorise that it is the human
“consciousness” that succeeds in a “godless” world, not the reversion to faith. In The Road,
McCarthy allows rules and moral outlooks to continue in the boy, through memories of his
Father, which creates a sense of positivity that even in a world absent of all meaning, the
human consciousness still remains, ready for “combat”. Yet Winston is placed in a stricter
reality, where the “silence of the world” is too fierce, for O’Brien claiming Winston is “the last
man alive” with any values, there is no one left to side with. This sense of loneliness in
comparison to the boy and the father continuing their faith in each other, ultimately defeats
Winston. His final cries to “do it to Julia”, shows how he abandons the last form of
connection. The Party removed that from him with force. Both authors observe connections
between people as a part of faith itself. Orwell suggests that faith in human spirit was lost the
moment Winston lost his final human companion in Lydia, and McCarthy implies that without
the boy, the man would simply not have chosen life in this world.
The accusations from both authors at the legitimacy of God, and the presence of faith in their
works, cause their stories to challenge true purpose and meaning. The existence that faith
provides is a reassuring one that the universe will compensate for death in the afterlife, yet
ignorant to any such ideas, the characters are confronted with the reflection of what true
meaning is, and what is their purpose. For both writers, the themes of absurdity flourish
around the challenge to prove existence is not futile. The character of Ely in The Road
proves significance to this argument. The only character to be named, this places his
importance to McCarthy above the protagonists themselves. The man and the boy can be
considered a generalisation for they are surface level in depth, it is the relationship between
them that matters; Ely is brought above this, placing his thoughts, details, and opinions to an
ethereal status. This biblical quality, alongside his name, makes parallels to the Christian
figure of the prophet Elijah. Meant to signify the coming of the Messiah and the betterment of
the world, Elijah is a holy being who brings significance to what is to come. The boy is
generous to Ely, he provides him with sustenance out of pure kindness, for there was no
transaction, only donation. When questioned if Ely believes the boy is a God, Ely denies and
“shakes his head”, for “there is no God and we are his prophets”. This admittance to the man

allows McCarthy to express how the ideals of religion are stories being told by people of the
past, that they are acting “prophets” for an ideal that does not exist. McCarthy suggests that
the answer is not religion. The weight carried in Ely not recognising holy qualities in the boy,
yet recognising the significance of being in the presence of a child, places the boy as a new
age of Prophet. McCarthy suggests that the purification of the world is not through religion of
the past, but intrinsic human values of the future generations. In a world where people
succumb to subhuman qualities, it is important to retain civility. Moreover, this may be a
warning from McCarthy that religious ideals of the past brought upon the destruction of the
world, and humanistic values is how we need to end the cycle of self-annihilation. Ely holds
a grudge against humanity, against the world he once knew, for he is an old man; he
believes “things will be better when everybody’s gone”. The nihilism of the world McCarthy
demonstrates in Ely is an attack on the current values of humans. McCarthy blames the
current state of humanity, through Ely. Our own attempt at self-elevation ultimately led to the
destruction of our own kind. McCarthy suggests that we need to enact change in order to
avoid the same fate. He does not suggest that we lose all morals, as the boy becomes a
beacon of guidance. He embodies the tradition of allowing humanistic values, passed on
from his father, to shape his new “consciousness”.
Orwell suggests the other extreme. He proposes a world in 1984 where a higher power has
too much coercion over the “consciousness”. Winston proves Orwell’s reasoning that the
human mind will reject too much control. For he actively tries to stop the moulding of his
mind to fit Big Brother’s ideals. Orwell himself has stated that. “Men are only as good as their
technical development allows them to be”. Big Brother is a warning to the readers of the
manipulation of the consciousness by a Machiavellian being or institution. Winston’s demise
is a sign that Orwell believes once power is attained, it cannot be removed. For “one makes
the resolution in order to establish the dictatorship”, Orwell admits the goal of The Party is to
retain the power they have, once an establishment has its foundations in, it is through
manipulation of the “consciousness” of people, through propaganda likely influenced by
Stalinism, that allow the vote to forever be skewed in their favour. Both authors are able to
represent two opposite worlds of the spectrum, yet create a horseshoe of evidence as they
connect on the same issue. Winston experiences a world of too much oppression, where the
boy is placed in pure unsolicited freedom. In turn, both come to the conclusion that the evil
and immoral are unguided and unchecked. Machiavellianism is not challenged by any form
of religious or sanctimonious beliefs, and the evil acts of The Party are not “combated” by
the misshapen “consciousness” of the public. The authors demonstrate different ways evil
can take form, however McCarthy suggests the boy’s humanistic values are a sign for
ending this cycle, whilst Orwel’s bleak world implies that once power is given, no matter how
strong the conscious mind is, the core values that make us human will also give in to the
power of authority.
To conclude, McCarthy and Orwell maintain many striking similarities in their approach to
Albert Camu’s opinions of human consciousness whilst choosing unique ways to display
their approaches. Orwell devises a universe where human connection and values are at the
core of human consciousness, yet displays the bleak demise it will suffer if left in the hands
of the oppressor. He enacts a warning to the threat ideologies of totalitarianism, Stalinism,
and the idea of a police state have on the human mind. McCarthy agrees that the centre of
human consciousness is the intrinsic value of humanism, but also suggests that by following
the practices of human thought, we can achieve betterment. Both extremes tackle religious

ideologies, yet through different means. The authors agree that religion plays a large role in
shaping the conscious mind, and reasoning with absurdity, and both suggest the idea of how
it may be replaced. Orwell proposes that political power replaces religious law, whilst
McCarthy encourages laws and values to be discovered through paying attention to the
human condition. Their presentation of consciousness relies heavily on human connection,
as they argue both the man and Winston suffer at the expense of loneliness, and agree that
human connection helps maintain a clear conscience amidst the absurdity of the world. In
full, the tales told both correlate a dystopian society with threats against instinctual human
values of consciousness. The point they diverge is upon the theme of hope. McCarthy
presents a world where an escape upon the condition that the characters are willing to look
inwards for improvement of the mind, whilst Orwell demonstrates a much more despairing
outlook that once power is taken, the conscious mind pays heavily, with no point of return.
